## Hello!
### This is my main pet project for now.

### About me
My name is Chaser (I'm a bit shy).  
You can find my contacts at the bottom of this page.  
Other projects are available on my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/MeRKaLyuT), for example [ready-react-start-app](https://github.com/MeRKaLyuT/Ready-react-start-app).

### About the project
This project is inspired by [roadmap.sh](https://roadmap.sh), but I want to make it more interactive and also a personal storage of skills.  
Itâ€™s built with **React** (pure JSX, no TypeScript for now), uses **ESLint** + **Husky** for linting and pre-commit checks.  
You can find all dependencies in `package.json`.
